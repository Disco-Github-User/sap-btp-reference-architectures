## **Business-to-government integration**
In many countries or regions organizations need to comply with local requirements mandating the submission of electronic documents such as invoices, summaries, or transport registrations, and statutory reports to external communication parties. Depending on the given exchange model these documents are transmitted through an authority, a regulated service provider, a regulated network or directly to the business partner. The actual exchange of data may be completely electronic or may require data to be downloaded or uploaded.
This reference architecture is based on the concepts of the **SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology**: Thereof, B2G integration is defined as an integration use case pattern which belongs to the process integration style. The diagram shows the runtime perspective for B2G integration covering the integration domains Cloud2Cloud and Cloud2OnPremise.

### Flow
There are three variants in place about how SAP solutions, such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Concur, SAP Business Network, SAP BusinessByDesign, exchange electronic documents and statutory reports with external communication parties: These variants range from a fully electronically exchange, manual down- and upload of formatted files to the manual entering of data in a web portal. Which variant is chosen depends on the technical integration requirements supported by the local authority. Whenever possible, a direct electronic transmission is supported. You can find an overview about which option per country/region and task are supported at SAP Help Portal (for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, see [Supported Compliance Tasks by Country/Region](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/71af4585db6d4904b1724730f3776c9b/097165e9c1074038847625e5c53e07d2.html?q=format&locale=en-US)).

For all variants the flow starts as follows (blue bullet points in the diagram):
1. An end user accesses an SAP cloud or on-premise solution using an application client and creates data that is relevant for electronic documents and/or statutory reports.
   
2. SAP Cloud Identity Services handle identity management and authentication allowing secure authentication.


**Variant: Electronic exchange using SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition** (pink bullet points and arrows in the diagram)

This is an SAP-managed cloud service that runs on SAP BTP and is based on SAP Integration Suite. It acts as a hub to centralize compliance across your enterprise, eliminating the need to implement local solutions for each country or scenario or business system.

3.	The electronic documents and statutory reports are sent toward SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition, which handles the exchange of electronic documents and statutory reports for several business scenarios. Depending on your business scenario the data is either sent to the Peppol network or to a local authority or designee thereof. Peppol is a set of specifications for establishing and is also the primary implementation of a federated electronic procurement system for use across different jurisdictions. With the help of Peppol, participant organizations can deliver procurement documents to each other including electronic invoices.
You can find an overview about which option is used per country/region at SAP Help Portal, see [Supported Business Scenarios](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-edition/sap-document-and-reporting-compliance-cloud-edition/supported-business-scenarios?locale=en-US).

4.	In case of an SAP on-premise solution SAP Connectivity service is used for selected scenarios. SAP Application Interface Framework can enable integration monitoring and error handling by business users.
   
5.	When there is a requirement to exchange electronic documents through the Peppol network the Peppol access point of SAP Document reporting and Compliance, cloud edition, connects with Peppol Services to determine metadata of the receiving business partners.
   
6.	Electronic documents are exchanged through the Peppol network with business partners which are members this network using AS4 based connectivity.
   
7.	If a business scenario is not based on Peppol the electronic documents are transmitted to the local authority or its designee.
   
8.	When an SAP solution submits a statutory report the business user can email correspondence items for the business partner with whom transactions are done, for the reported period. Such emails are sent directly from the SAP solution to the business partner. As alternative options such correspondence can also be printed out.

**Variant: Electronic exchange using SAP Integration Suite** (grey bullet points and arrows in the diagram)

3. An SAP cloud or on-premise solution exchanges data for electronic documents and statuary reports with the Cloud Integration capability of SAP Integration Suite.
   
4.	In case of an SAP on-premise solution, it is recommended to SAP Connectivity service with cloud connector and SAP Destination service to establish a secure connection from SAP BTP to the on premise landscape. SAP Application Interface Framework can enable integration monitoring and error handling for business users.
   
5.	SAP Business Accelerator Hub provides predefined integration flows for B2G integration scenarios which you deploy on Cloud Integration.
   
6.	The electronic documents are sent to in the right format to the tax authorities' or designee’s platform.

   
**Variants: Manual data exchange** (turquois bullet points and arrows in the diagram)

3.	The SAP solution generates output files for the compliance documents which meet the formatting requirements of the respective local authority. Business users can upload these files through web portals or similar of the local authority.

4. A business user enter the data directly in the authorities' portal or other local applications/providers.

### Characteristics
The following list outlines characteristics, which are specific for an architecture that support B2G integration:
- **Compliance-oriented**: B2G integration primarily focuses on ensuring compliance with government regulations, policies, and standards. It involves exchanging data and information to meet legal requirements, such as tax filings, reporting obligations, and adherence to industry-specific regulations.
- **Standardization**: B2G integration often requires adherence to specific data formats, protocols, and standards defined by government agencies. Standardization ensures consistency, compatibility, and ease of integration between business and government systems.
- **Continuous update of integration policies**: Governments frequently update regulations and policies, requiring businesses to adapt their integration processes accordingly. B2G integration should be flexible enough to accommodate these changes and ensure ongoing compliance.
- **Auditability and traceability**: B2G integration often requires maintaining detailed audit logs and traceability of data exchanges. This helps ensure transparency, accountability, and the ability to demonstrate compliance during audits or investigations.
- **Multi-agency interactions**: B2G integration may involve interactions with multiple government agencies, departments, and business partners. You need to integrate with different systems, processes, and requirements across various government entities.

### Examples in an SAP Context
SAP delivers predefined B2G integration scenarios along end-to-end business processes spanning across multiple SAP business applications. Here are some examples:
